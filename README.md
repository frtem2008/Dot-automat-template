# Dot-automat-template
It's a simple dot automat template. Made by me in 2 days. Usually doesn;t lag. Enjoy. All code is commented.

To move use WASD. To increase integration per second use Up Arrow and Down Arrow. To scale use mouse wheel. To return to default scale use clicking on mouse wheel. To return to default integrations per second use CTRL + clicking on mouse wheel.
